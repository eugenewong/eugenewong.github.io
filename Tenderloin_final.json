We were so fortunate to get the last parking spot at a garage about 50 ft from the restaurant and at a very good price ($10). We were seated at a rather small table but it was fine for the 3 of us. I enjoyed the vintage quaintness yet classy setting. Our waiter really knew the wine list and was great at helping us pick out a bottle that would compliment our food choices. He also led us to a wine made locally, Quinta Cruz, which I really like to support. We started with the lentil spread and bread, the bread being hearty and tasty while the lentil spread was delightful! We had the shaved brussel sprouts with BBQ tofu pieces....yum, herbed olives and the pad thai salad. For our entrees we had the tamale, cauliflower and squash entrees. We shared everything which is the way to go as I could never pick one item here and feel like I got to experience Millennium. My only suggestion would be that we should have been given larger plates rather than just using the bread plate. It was rather awkward but we managed and we were so excited that we didn't take the time to ask for a larger plate! Service was good, waiter and busboy were very attentive and personable.

As the name implies, it is hidden away on Hyde street in the Tenderloin. If it weren't for the quaint BBQ sign hanging on the side of the building, or the hand written sandwich board announcing the daily specials, you might miss it. Stepping inside feels like coming home. It is the neighborhood kitchen that you wish you grew up in -- a place where friends stop in just to say hello, and neighbors get to know one another. Something about sharing a single table and the cozy decor makes you feel like it's your favorite aunt's kitchen. The owner, Tammy, is the heart and soul of the place. She seems to know everyone who passes in front of her door, and has always made me feel me and my boyfriend feel like regulars, even though we only stop in about once a month. I can't describe the love that I feel when I sit down in here. It just flows out of Tammy and into the food. The food! The food is absolutely top-notch. The menu is extensive and full of award winning dishes, but I usually just order whatever is on special. To be honest, I'm happy to get whatever is not sold out. It is my understanding that because the restaurant has no kitchen, the food is prepared in advance off-site, heated in the restaurant, and once they are sold out for the day, that's it, come back tomorrow. I'm okay with this system because the food tastes unmistakably home made and I like knowing that everything is fresh for the day. My only complaint is that I always get there too late for dessert -- the pecan pie and peach cobbler always seem to be the first items to sell out. \u00a0This is comfort food, plain and simple.
