Trust me, it was amazing. The following day I kept telling my boyfriend about how much I enjoyed the panna cotta, and I'm sure he wanted to slap me because I would not shut up about how good it was!

But the two main courses were total westernized rubbish that shouldn't exists at the heart of Chinatown: the first course used tomato sauce for starch, authentic Hunan food never use starch in the first place, let alone tomato sauce in starch. The second one was Hunan Smoked Pork: it's NOT even Hunan style smoked pork. It's obviously Cantonese style: red, grilled, sweet instead of black, smoked, spicy and full of flavor. Hunan food is also normally famous for its spiciness, oily over high fire, both of our main dishes taste bland and sour. I understand why it is getting four star overall reviews despite our experience. It is perfectly westernized Cantonese food with a random Hunan branding, the dining area is also tidier and cleaner than regular Chinese restaurants, catering to its western customers. The server were all dressed up giving you this upscale vibe (the service though is no better than regular Chinese restaurant, we were basically invisible to them after ordering, and it took a long time for the to notice that we are ready for the check, when wife stands up and starts leaving our table, but we don't care and we still tip). But make no mistake, this is no Hunan food, not even good Chinese food. There is no shame in catering to its specific market segment. It might very well be a more profitable market. There is also no shame starting from westernized Chinese food if you really do enjoy its food, kudos for trying something different. The shame is in the restaurant's use of the word \"Hunan\" and reference of Hunan food on its menu.

Anyways....like everything we got. Octopus was good. Cacio de pepe was too cheesy it was gloppy and not creamy. The tiramisu was perfect. The problem is here.....We got the chicken liver. We both love chicken liver. We are BOTH chefs here in SF.!! It came out and it was on a skewer.

I was in so much abdominal pain that I almost fainted twice. It lasted strong for 3 days. A couple days later after returning to work I texted my same friend and asked her when we can schedule our next meal together, that's when she said she has been bed ridden due to food poisoning. That's when my jaw dropped. I told her I had the same thing and it must have been our dinner from earlier in the week. We remembered the \"if-y\" liver we ate. I emailed tosca and told them what happened. Only seemed like the right thing to do. I wasn't blaming them And I wasn't mad or upset, but being in the food business I just thought it's something I should share.

The staff was efficient and pleasant, and the line went quickly. The food was a big let down. Last time I checked \"kale salad\" didn't mean 40% arugula, 60% kale. The salad was wilted and flavorless, besides the very obvious taste of arugula. To my soggy salad I added a \"pimento cheese deviled egg\" which was fine, but was obviously filled with a mixture of mostly mayo, a little egg yolk, and pimento. There was no such cheese element. The display of house-made treats begged me to try one palm-sized salted chocolate chip cookie (to balance out the kale, ya know). I was deeply saddened to bite into a seemingly molasses cookie, dotted with 3 chocolate chips.

The sandwiches were always great and never skimpy. The hate part is having to review it with a disappointment. Years later(now) the sandwiches are $3.50 and less sandwich meat. I barely had any pickled carrots (which is my fav) and they even skimped on the pate. They had a large variety of packaged meals to go as shown on their picture menu board but yet, They didn't have my first choice when I asked for it, they didn't even have my 2nd choice when I disappointedly had to come up with a second choice.

{"reviews": [{"date": "2014-11-19", "text": "You know this place is \u00a0kinda special. Why? Because, everyone who was raised in, hung around in, or used to frequent Chinatown, knows that over the years, \"the best food,\" has by and large left Chinatown for other areas around SF and beyond. The reasons for the exodus are many, among which is the fact that as the previous older generations of Cantonese immigrants (mostly from Hong Kong) families matured, the later generations moved out, taking with them an economic base that sustained good restaurants and quality food. The present inhabitants of Chinatown which replaced them, are recent immigrants from China that occupy a lower economic rung and cannot sustain the big fancy Chinatown eating palaces of old, (Empress of China, imperial Palace, Four Seas etc. all now closed or closing,) causing a reliance by these restaurants on the tourist trade and therefore a decline in the quality of the food.This reality, coupled with the fact that after the Golden Dragon Shooting several decades ago,and the closing, then opening and \u00a0\"shrinking\" of that popular restaurant, people just stopped coming to Chinatown to eat. That created the present void in Chinatown for anything but \"HK cafe style\" food, or take home BBQ and rice plate places (on Stockton St. The \"local marketplace\" street.) that are popular and preferred by the new generation of Chinatown residents, primarily \u00a0from South China. So when we can go out as a group of friends, as we did recently, and eat well in Chinatown these days, (anywhere other than the mighty R&G restaurant, the present Chinatown reigning king of good food,) it's a cause for celebration. And celebrate is what I would like to do, at a place that has withstood everything I mentioned for decades and is still going strong, turning out delicious dishes and Cantonese comfort food consistently, from a huge menu, with creative food choices, including some seldom offered old time Cantonese country classics. I am talking about Washington Bakery and Restaurant, on Washington St. across from Portsmouth Square, (the Chinatown Park and Garage). Care to take me out on my B'day? Bring me here please! And we will eat well, for a reasonable price, along with a restaurant completely full of local folks and others from all parts of Frisco, that know how to eat well.

If it's dinner like I'm hoping, we'll be sure to order their famous signature \"Wun Tun, chicken noodle,\" (sam wo win run gai) and salt and pepper squid, seafood noodles with egg, \"sam pan jook\", (three innard meats porridge,) salt and pepper fried tofu, (tzao daoufu,) Tofu and Beef pork, fried egg omelette with vegetables, Beef liver and vegetables, chinese greens, ox tail stew and finally chocolate blueberry cake to top it off.

When the sushi chef returned bringing me a hot tea, I asked him \"what kind of umeshu do you have?\", using the Japanese word for plum wine. Sushi chef looks at me like I am from another planet. I repeat myself and he still doesn't know what I'm talking about. Okay, I think. This guy is obviously not Japanese, as he doesn't even know the Japanese word for plum wine. So I finally asked him what kind of plum wine do they carry, red or white? (I wanted white). He told me that there is no such thing as white Japanese plum wine. I'm like, \"Excuse me?\" He kept insisting that there was no such thing as white. I asked him if he had ever been to Japan, Osaka especially, where there are a plethora of many different kinds of plum wine. Then he said, \"Well, they only serve white wine in Japan. Not here in America.\" I'm like, \"Have you ever heard of choya? I can get that at Nijiya market in Japantown.\" \u00a0He didn't answer, and walked away. I thought that was so rude! If he didn't have white wine, he just should have SAID so and not try to give me a BS story about the non-existance of white plum wine period, and then about the non existance of white plum wine in America. I've eaten at a lot of Japanese restaurants and many of them offer the white variety! I do not have stupid written all over my forehead. \u00a0I wanted to call him names in Japanese (not that he would have understood me.). Two other patrons left and I was the only patron left in the building. The chef gives me cold looks, which I return. He finally comes over to take my order, and I order the salmon teriyaki dinner with rice, salad, and miso soup. He briefly pops into the kitchen, shouts out my order, and then returns to the sushi bar. The kitchen is partially open at the bar, and to my horror I see a Mexican cook in there. Okaaaay... so much for Japanese authenticity. While I was shuddering about the non-Japaneseness of the cook, Celine Dion's \"My Heart Will Go On\" comes on the radio, and the sushi chef comes back out carrying my salad and miso soup on a tray, and sets it down at my table. Then as he retreats back to the bar, decides to start singing along to Celine!! \u00a0I'm like, come on, this can't be happening! \u00a0Of course he sounded terrible! Thankfully he shut up after a few bars, as I'm sure my looks were piercing him to the core. \u00a0The food took way longer to come out than it should have, being that I was the only person in the restaurant. Presentation was good, but the pieces of salmon were tiny tiny tiny. I did, however enjoy the mixed vegetables (Carrots, onions, and mushrooms, yay!) \u00a0that were sauteed along with the salmon, but the salmon itself was bland, bland bland. I finished it all, but overall my experience there left a lot to be desired, and I made sure to express that sentiment when I tipped. There is no reason to go here for un-authentic, mediocre food.

I'll admit the place is small but it's Chinatown. The restaurants in the area are small and it hard to get a bigger place when you're in a historical area like Chinatown.

Then after awhile, the food came and it looked okay....then i tasted the food! OMG the food here is so good!!! I cant believe such a small restaurant has such good CHICKEN WINGS!! The waiter was old and she was moving very slow, but she had very good service. I can't expect much with a one man server.

We got hungry and walked by and saw a sign that says Ox-tail stew rice platter. The rice came out lukewarm, and very stale, like day old rice. By that time the rice has hardened and was not edible. My husband got the codfish rice platter. He seem to like it, but then again, you'll put anything in his face and he'll eat it anyway, no questions asked. My oxtail stew wasn't really ox-tails stew. It was a couple of bones with some meat attached to it. I counted it and it was thee tiny pieces (mostly bones) and everything else was soybean stuff.

That server was really rude just throwing stuff on the table as she served. Recently, I've went by and saw that they were under new management with new waitress and cook so I decided to try there again with my bff. I was totally amazed because there was a 360 degree turn from service and the food. Although their new construction might not be the best but my bff and I felt that this place was amazing. I got the imperial spareribs and she got the pan fried noodles. And of course, we had to share the fried chicken wings! It was all too good and too much to finish, and surely, we took it home.

We ordered some dim sum and I gotta say, their Hai Gao and Siu Mai was actually pretty fresh and good. However, I can't say the same goes for the rest. One order came out cold and they had to bring it back into the kitchen to re-steam it. After they brought it out, I tried half a bite and didn't even want to eat it anymore.
