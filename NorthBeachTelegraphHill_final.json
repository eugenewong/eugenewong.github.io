On a referral from my boss, Scoma's was the place to go. Situated in the wharf area, Scoma's is tucked away from the street, almost secluded. They process the seafood on premises - cleaning, filleting, etc. You can watch them through a picture-glass window right next to the restaurant. The interior design is nautically themed, yet classic. A long bar is near the entrance where you can have a libation while waiting for your table. The dining room is beautiful with glass on both sides of the restaurant. While there's not much to see at night, we did watch seagulls perch on the wooden wharf beams outside watching us eat our dinner. I love clam chowder and it is usually one of my staples that I use to test the level of the food. This has to be the best clam chowder I've ever had! It's creamy, buttery, and chocked full of clams. It was held and served at the perfect temperature so the cream didn't break. I worked with clam chowder for 9 years at Disneyland and you really had to watch the holding temperature. Once the cream breaks, the soup loses its creamy texture (almost like curdled milk) and needs to be discarded. The fresh cracked black pepper on top sealed the deal. Scoma's, you had me at \"clam chowder\"! I decided to try something off of their daily special menu, Lobster Raviolis topped with lobster tail and salmon fillet. It was pretty good. The salmon needed a little more seasoning, but had a nice buttery flavor and soft texture. The lobster tail was tender and perfectly cooked. The raviolis were okay. I would have liked more herbs like tarragon, rosemary, and/or oregano to punch up the sauce as it was a little heavy. \u00a0My mom ordered the Dungeness Crab. \u00a0As it was summer, it was out of season so it was \"fresh frozen\". She was a little disappointed that she couldn't have the insides (miso or mustard of the crab) as they are cleaned out when prepped. Our server assured us that if we came back during Dungeness crab season that we could order it with the \"miso\" intact.

Let me clarify, I did not set foot outside of the door I only looked outside to make sure my girlfriend was OK. At this point, the bartender very rudely asked me to give him my drink. I believe he was trying to make up for his prior mistake of letting us take the drinks outside and to look good in front of the owner. Once again, I did not put up a fight and gave him my drink and the bartender never mentioned that I was cut off or could not have another drink. About 5 minutes later, my buddy had an extra drink, which he gave to me. When the bartender saw me with another drink he proceeded to officially kick me and my whole group of friends out of the bar.

Our waiter seemed very busy and finally after almost 20 minutes came over to take our drink order. We ordered martinis and wine. He brought back the martinis but the martinis were the wrong ones he totally forgot the wine for almost another 10 minutes. By now we are at the 25 minute mark the restaurant was very busy. Finally the wine came and he placed our food orders most of us had pasta I had the halibut. Everyone's food came except my halibut and he apologized saying it would be out shortly so another five minutes passes while my friends are going ahead and eating I'm sitting with just my glass of wine. Then the ma\u00eetre d' came out and also apologize saying the food was on the way he apologized and said there was nothing more he could do please except my apologies which was very nice. Then my halibut came and I was relieved because we had a dinner theater show afterward so now I could start eating my friends were already at least halfway through their meal. The first bite of the halibut was okay but I noticed it was a little tough. The second bite I couldn't even pull the halibut away from the rest of the piece because it was 100% completely raw inside. I had to send the raw fish back it looked like it had been poached in hot boiling water for no more than maybe two minutes it definitely had not even been inside of a saut\u00e9 pan. When I asked another waiter if he could help us and explain my fish was raw he immediately looked at us and yelled at our table \"Who's your waiter?\" And walked away. I understand when restaurants get busy and things go wrong in the bar or the kitchen it happens we understand but the rudeness of the waitstaff and the fact the food wasn't even properly prepared was not cool. it finally came back out another 10 minutes later. By now my friends had completely finished their meal and I am just starting mine. we're now late for a dinner theater by almost half an hour so the entire experience from my side was somewhat ruined and I know my friends felt bad as well. Mostly because I recommended the restaurant. I'm not sure I would go back after being treated this way. San Francisco has so many restaurants with grateful wait staff and properly cooked food.

I popped open my lamb gyros plate and was shocked to find the majority of the piece had huge veins/fatty tissue. There was barely any edible meat. It was all fat. The rice on each plate was literal mush. And to top it off this place somehow found a way to screw up hummus. What we got was bland and almost play dough like in texture. Pita bread was ok though. We gave everything one bite and boxed it back up. Some might say we caught them on an \"off night\"... Fuck that. The food their employees knowingly gave us looked terrible and tasted even worse!

We ordered the whole crab ($33), clam, clam linguini ($18), salmon special ($24 - see picture), and bowl of clam chowder ($8) with all the sourdough bread you can eat with waters (must requests in this drought). I always order NON-alcoholic beer Clausthaler ($5) and 2 raspberry iced teas ($6). Service was above average with the wait staff quite young and somewhat inexperienced; we had to ask for more bread, sweetener, and SHOO the flies away ourselves (for these prices, I wish they'd keep the doors screened). Everything was fresh and worth the inflated prices just for the 2nd floor view alone. My tip was 18% and the total was $120. Of course, I don't do this very often and usually when guests are in town ... park at the small pier parking at 170 Jefferson St ($15) and make this memory special for everyone!", "stars": "4.0"}, {"date": "2014-08-08", "text": "After walking for a long time we wanted a place that had great seafood and where we could also sit and enjoy the view.

The egg tonnato was very good, the egg making a natural pairing with tonnato sauce. It was a great alternative to the traditional veal recipe. \u00a0The tuna conserva with radishes on the other hand lacked brightness that should have counterbalanced the heavy oiliness of the tuna and the creaminess of the cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche. The crispy pig tails, while cooked perfectly and full of flavor, were over-salted as were the crispy potatoes many of which were fried to death. The turnips were so very average. There weren't many enticing secondi choices. We settled on the hangar steak because we wanted a meat dish and didn't want to wait one hour for the chicken. Had we known the service would be so slow we might have ordered it. The hangar steak was tasty if uninventive. Not all the dishes were uninspired. The bucatini with guanciale and chile was undeniably the star dish of the evening.

The spanikopita was delicious and it was a large portion, but the filo was soggy/ chewy. The avgolemono (lemon) soup... I could have made it better. The olive oil, by the way, was fabulous... made in Crete and imported especially for estia.

I must admit that I was surprised and more than satisfied just with her attention and sincerity. I actually didn't accept the offer of a free dinner - for two!- because I didn't want to give the impression that I had written a bad review in order to get this consideration. I'm not that kind of person. But I did remove my review. After all, it was only a matter of having had a reservation but having to wait almost an hour. (The blame may have belonged to Open Table, in fact.) But after this truce, I eventually returned to Il Fornaio on many occasions and always enjoyed wonderful meals and excellent service. The Happy Hours are the best in town. The ginger mojito is my favorite, served in a sturdy, tall tumbler. The menu changes to reflect the seasons and, I suppose, the whims of the chef.

I thought if I mentioned it was our anniversary that maybe she would have realized it was an important night for us but she didn't seem to hear me and definitely didn't acknowledge it. She took our appetizer order and said she would be back for the rest of our order later. The appetizer was a crab sampler with a crab cake, crab bruschetta and crab legs and it was tasty and well made. But she never came back to take our main course order. We finished our appetizer and two glasses of wine each as we watched her frantically move around her side of the room but accomplishing very little. I finally had to say as she bumped my chair from behind that she still needed to take our order for the rest of our anniversary meal, thinking that mentioning it again she might do a better job finally. She didn't. Instead, she took our order in a huff with no apology. We both had the fish and chips (on recommendation from previously mentioned friend) which although doesn't sound like I high dollar item it did run $17.95 per meal. The breaded cod was crispy and not fishy and the fries were adequate but quite frankly the dinner had been ruined by our servers appalling behaviour. I kept wishing we had the other brunette server who was working our area as she was doing an excellent job. At the very end of the meal, I think our server tried to do damage control before bringing the check as she brought a small scoop of vanilla ice cream with a candle in it. Honestly, I was so irritated by then I didn't care what she did to get a better tip. It was very apparent why she changed on a dime 5 minutes before she brought us the almost $100 bill. I understand that severs can have an off-day but this was way beyond that. Even my husband who is pretty patient man was appalled at her lack of ability to do her job.", "stars": "2.0"}, {"date": "2014-06-21", "text": "Best linguini and clams u ever had.

I have NEVER commented on restrooms in my reviews before, but this one MUST NOT go unnoticed with such a pricey menu and prominent locale. After I ordered my dinner, I went to use the women's restroom. There were two stalls. One was occupied, and the latch was evidently either missing or broken. I proceeded to the unoccupied stall, closed the door, went to latch it, but the latch was broken. As I quickly went about my business, someone walked in, when I felt compelled to announce \"the latches are broken, both stalls are occupied, please don't come in.\" The woman in the other stall and I both emerged, talking to the third woman who entered and the woman from the other stall said something about the toilet not flushing and that she used her hands to try to flush. Not quite sure what she meant. My point is why on earth would a restaurant that charges $31.95 for petrale sole not provide adequate restroom facilities for its customers?

The problem with the cannoli is that it's not fresh. \u00a0The guy just took some from a cardboard box and filled them with some sort of cream and dried fruit. \u00a0It just did not taste good. \u00a0And it's not cheap either at $8/each. \u00a0In short, it was a very disappointing meal from beginning to end including wine.", "stars": "1.0"}, {"date": "2014-05-20", "text": "Food was very bland.

We assumed that they would at least take these expensive items off the bill but they brought us a very expensive bill for sub-par food. We had to have them correct the mistake. The calimari was hardly cooked and inedible. When one of our party asked to have her untouched pasta boxed up, the server instead threw it away! When 10 mins after we settled the bill, I still had not received the leftovers, I inquired as to where they were, the Manager insisted that he was very sorry and would make a whole new dish! We waited and waited AND WAITED for the dish.

Heck, we are in the area and we jetted to Mcdonald's in Fisherman's Wharf. It is a tourist trap so my advice is, come after 6pm when metered parking is free, grab one of those SF Guide books and maps which can be found on every corner and bring a friend along for a very satisfying Mcdonald's meal. For less than 6 bucks, my friend and I got two chicken nugget meals and I am definitely not complaining. Service is quick here and this Mcdonald's is super busy and crazy. But if you want to save a few bucks, follow my steps and you'll just be as happy as I was hahaha. Oh how I love Mcdonald's chicken nuggets, funny I just had some a few minutes ago lol.
