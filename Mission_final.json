Fried perfectly and the white meat was still moist and flavorful. Usually white meat is dry and bland... but not here!

So I yelped to see what was around and TACOLICIOUS popped up. I saw the reviews and decided to give it a try. I already knew this place was not going to be authentic buttt I heard good things about it so decided to go with that. I first walked in and you can see that there was no seating and there would be a bit of a wait. So the lady in front took my name down and said it would be at least a 15-20 min wait for 2. Ok that didn't sound too bad so we waited. literately as we walked in there was a massive of people who came storming in right after us. It was crazy because all of a sudden it got super busy. Anyway we were still waiting and I got a little impatient as I saw the group of 18 get seated. how the hell did they get seated and we got here way before they did. But oh well. Still waiting. so I had my girlfriend go ask how long the wait was going to be for a seat. She said another 15-20 min. Girrrrl you said that the first time. So we have been waiting for at least 30-40 min now. That's why I am giving this place 4 stars for the wait. I understand this place is popular and they have so many people to cater to but if there is a list that you put me on GO BY THAT LIST. Mind you this was at night time around 7-8pm. anyway we finally got seated outside. The waiter brought some chips and salsa out. OMG that salsa and chips was on point. The salsa tasted so fresh and so good. you can tell it was house made. Not spicy at all but had a hint of right zest. I love cilantro and you can taste the extractions of cilantros in the salsa. Mmmm we ordered the beef short rib taco and traditional carnitas tacos. 4 for $16. A little pricey but worth every taste for what it was. So much flavor in the meat. I liked the fact that when the tacos were brought out there was 3 types of salsas that came with it as well. Mild guac, medium, and habanero. I love choices and condiments. That's a plus everytime I have choices. We also had the queso cheese dip. that was also very delicious. Very creamy and thick full of peppers and veggies mixed in. Could not finish it since there was only two and it came in a bowl. We also ordered a pitcher of SANGRIA. $30 for a pitcher which will be 4 cups in total. one cup of sangria is about 9.50. So your at least getting one sangria free by ordering the pitcher that is if you will drink two cups each. At first I wasn't so sure how to feel about the sangria. I thought it was ok at first but the more I drank it I actually realllllly liked it. No that's not the alcohol just kicking it. It was actually this taste I didn't realize it had until a few sips later. it has a tad bit pico de gallo chili mixed in with a tiny hint of sweet but of course the wine was still there to overpower. Chili and sweet is something I am all for. Finished both glasses. I can't forget about our waitress. I loved her customer service. She was very attentive and came around when she needed to. I can tell by her body language that she was trying to check up on us but not interrupt our conversation we were having. I liked that because that shows she was being courteous as well in a shuttle way. anyway, I liked her patience in packing the left overs we had. I not only asked her once but twice to do it since we weren't done with our queso. but she seemed gladly to do it and came back with extra chips. I feel like that's how customer service should be.

While they all looked like the food was good, most of them had lousy or non-existent decor and there were an awful lot of sketchy looking people on the street, practically blocking the restaurant doorways, which really didn't encourage us to walk in (not their fault of course). Los Coyotes is a half block off of Mission, on 16th St. and the inside was much nicer than the other places, with tile mosaic tables and pretty spacious area. So we stayed and ate there. I had the Red Mole Chicken plate: whole beans, rice, a little melted cheese and a huge serving of tender white meat chicken with plenty of mole sauce and 4 homemade corn tortillas. I liked it but thought the mole sauce was kind of bland. In all fairness, I have nothing to compare it to because I've never had a red mole guiza before, but I thought it would have something more interesting about the flavor. I added squeezes of lime and a few drops of hot sauce, which helped. It was enough food for 2 meals easily, so I ended up taking a lot of it home. My dh's fish burrito was fine, and very filling. He couldn't finish it there, so took the rest home to finish later. It looks like most reviews are for burritos and tacos, but they have a really extensive menu with lots of choices.

First, Destino is not a Peruvian restaurant; it is Peruvian fusion. One look at the menu and I only recognized three to four dishes that are typically Peruvian. Besides that fact, the food is delicious and props for presentation. However, I am giving them a one star for the way the servers handled my friend's vegetarian needs. This was specially surprising considering the many vegetarian options on the menu. As we were about to order our many course, my friend asked server #2 to please let our main sever #1 that we are ready to order. Server #2 said that it is fine for him to take our order. My friend asked about the ensalada de Destino as the ingredients were not clear and the room was dark. He especially asked if there was meat in the salad. Server #2 confirmed to him that the salad was meat free. Half an hour later we get our meals and we realize that salad had bacon. I looked at the menu and noticed that one of the ingredients was \"jamon\". How could a Spanish server not realize this? When my friend asked the server #2 to explain himself, the server #2 was apologetic and summoned our main server #1. He was also upset and took off the salad from our bill. However, server #1 had the nerve to remind my friend that the menu strictly states the ingredients of yhe dish. That is when my friend blew up and said that the severs should take responsibility for their false assurance. He then asked to get his whole meal comped but the server #1 just laughed and walked away. This was ridiculous! So everyone at that restaurant is expected to know what \"jamon\" means? Also, should we not be able to trust our servers recommendations? This place needs an attitude adjustment and realize that vegetarian eaters take this very seriously. I won't be coming here again.

Kind but not enough to make up for the experience. By the time we received our food an hour and a half later, the place was clearing out, I'd lost my appetite and wasn't impressed enough by the food to make the wait worth it! Our tab was almost $70 and when I asked the bartender to comp at least the 2 beers he said he couldn't because he'd be fired. Moments later I heard him introducing himself as the owner... UMMM ARE YOU JOKING? I'm typically the easiest person to please service wise but after patiently waiting an hour and a half for our food, comping two beers on tap is the absolute least that could be done.

We asked the band to sing happy birthday to our friend. The band said for us to write her name down on a tip and put it in the jar. Quite rude.

If you are going to perform in a restaurant while patrons are dining- it is one thing to have a tip jar, another to announce the tip jar while going around the restaurant with said tip jar and begging for tips.

Even the packaging materials that mimicked Japanese sushi tray for rolls and sashemi have been replaced with Chinese delivery plastic containers. Even supermarkets package sushi in proper containers.

So i go back, horrible service waiting to sit, FILTHY TABLES, in fact FILTHY EVERYTHING. straight up sticky shit all over everything, yea, its one of those sushi places where they never really clean. i ordered an orange juice, and, they gave me a glass of that really cheap brownish orange juice that is just expired as all hell. the kind you get at a gas station or corner liquor store. lets see what else, oh, they only had the low sodium soy sauce at my table, when i asked for the other one they looked at me like im crazy, the problem with this place is that it is family run by a lazy dirty family with general all around low standards, i've been giving this place a chance about once a year for the past 7 or 8 years and it still hasnt performed, i dont think it ever will.

The drink as like any other place, but the shake was horrible. I guess I expected a lot coming from Torrance, CA where there are decent people cooking decent pre-cooked food. So i sat down, and got the drinks. As stated before, the milkshake was mediocre, tasting of too much vanilla and syrup. By the time I got home, it separated which looked nasty. I went to get a flat lid for the McCafe (I'm weird like that) so I could ensure safe travel of my milkshake via Bart. I waited and waited at the front expecting someone to answer my request for my lid. I asked someone, who said they \"couldn't\". Once the line finally died down twice, I went up to the lady, irritated with my experience, and ended up not getting one because they \"didn't have one\"... however, I saw the manager get a lid for someone else. Yeah, not going back. Bad area, mediocre food.

We walked in and there was a line at the counter, but we must've looked the type who were going to sit down, so the waitress came up to us and asked (in Spanish) if we were going to \"eat here\" and she told us to sit down and she brought us a basked of chips and menus. The salsa with the chips was pico de gallo. There were also two bottle of salsa on the table. NONE of these salsas had any flavor. No lie. They lacked salt. I have a heart condition, so I'm not a big salt eater, so that should tell you something. I ended up ordering the baby burrito with chicken and mole because of all the rave reviews.

But, this food so lacked in flavor that I would be afraid to try the tacos. I also have to say although everyone speaks Spanish there, I don't think the operators of this Mexican restaurant are Mexican. They sound Central American and the food is more Central American style. If I want that, I would go down the street and have a pupusa or nacatamal. Central American food isn't typically as spicy as Mexican so I think my assumption is correct.

They have your basic sodas; coke, sprite, orange, etc, Snapple, if you want water, it's better to order the cup of water with ice, because they charge you for a bottled water, they have your basic beer, Coronas, Heniken, Tecate(I think?) etc. for about $3..", "stars": "4.0"}, {"date": "2011-05-21", "text": "The golden rule of being under $10 and satisfying can be observed here.
