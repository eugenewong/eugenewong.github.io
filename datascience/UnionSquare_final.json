The gentlemen in a yellow shirt with an orange colored pattern looked at it and acknowledged the mistake and said he would take care of it. I walked back to my table and started eating the French fries and noticed that they weren't hot (I shouldn't have been too surprised since I noticed a bit earlier that they were sitting on top of a counter near the fryer for longer than they should have. This is all about timing, why have the fries ready before the burger is cooked and prepared?). They were closer to white than golden brown in color. I decided to not say anything about the fries. My burger was brought back to me a short while later and all the worker did was stuff 2 slices of cold cheese inside. How could this be considered OK?

We had already ordered our main course and figured, \"well, we already ordered, so we might as well stay and give the food a chance right? WRONG!\" I ordered the fried oysters and not only were they oily, they smelled like they have been a few days old. I'm sorry, but I won't eat old oysters. My Mom ordered the crab ravioli, but she mentioned that the taste of crab was lacking. Not only that, but the ravioli's were completely drenched in sauced. (It looked a bit like the clam chowder we had earlier to be honest.) My Dad, being a huge steak lover, ordered a steak and told them to cook it medium rare. The meat was really tough and overdone and had very little seasoning. When we received the check we were blown away by the price. I am fine with paying a little more for good quality food, but this is unacceptable. We ended up eating a slice of pizza at Blondie's down the street because we were so unsatisfied with our meal.
