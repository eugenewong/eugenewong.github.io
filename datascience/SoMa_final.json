The baguette sandwiches are perfect; they travel well and are easy to share. The hot sandwiches are delicious and large but get soggy after a while.

Well done, Boulevard, well done.", "stars": "5.0"}, {"date": "2014-09-30", "text": "I gave this place 2 stars for the wine, as the food and place was average at best. We had the swordfish, and pork, but both meals were boring, unimaginative, and lacking accompaniments to make them stand out. \u00a0The place is loud, and crowded, when the waiter asked me how the meal was, and I explained the above, he advised that due to being so busy, they have to make the meals with Subtle \u00a0tastes. \u00a0Very disappointed in this place after reading the reviews on here.", "stars": "2.0"}, {"date": "2014-09-30", "text": "I went to Boulevard with some friends and we had a wonderful time. We started off with a special pasta dish to share with white truffles, which was absolutely fabulous. I recommend not sharing it, and getting it as your starter. For main dishes I would highly recommend the Kurabuta Pork or the Filet of beef. Both were excellent dishes. We passed on the dessert and went with a cheese plate. The cheese plate is good, but not great. Nobody beats Garyo Danko for cheeses. The restaurant was packed like always, even 5 years ago during the recession. The service was pretty good, and I recommend getting the table in the back of the restaurant so you can enjoy the views of the Bay Bridge both for dinner and lunch. Overall, a great place to come enjoy a fine meal with friends or on date night. A little tweaks here and there and this place will be 5 stars on my list. Boulevard isn't going anywhere for years to come during good times and even the bad times of the economy. This place is here to stay and great location as well.", "stars": "4.0"}, {"date": "2014-09-29", "text": "Good service, good food.", "stars": "4.0"}, {"date": "2014-09-29", "text": "Wonderful experience at the Boulevard. My boyfriend and I were visiting San Francisco and wanted to try a place that fit our foodie needs/wants. The presentation of the food was spot on and the service complimented the experience perfectly. Our waitress was very knowledgable about the food including origin, how it was prepared and how she would suggest we remake the dishes at our own home. Very happy with the experience and my boyfriend and I look forward to visiting again with our friends.", "stars": "5.0"}, {"date": "2014-09-27", "text": "Our go-to place in San Francisco.

Excellent food and reasonable price. We had 1 starter, 2 entrees, 2 wines for a total of $144 before tips. I do hate that they charge the SF health fee.
