The pizza has to cook awhile, but after around 20 minutes when I asked one of the other servers when we'd be served, she said she'd get right back to me and never did. Often enough, I saw the one cook they have in the back just waiting around for orders to fill, but maybe she had things in the oven and was waiting for them to bake. I'll give them the benefit of the doubt. But when we were finished and waiting for the check, I again (foolishly) asked the other server for the bill and after another \"I'll get it to you right away\", she never came back and I was forced to ask the owner for it again.

There were like 10 workers in the small ass \"restaurant\". It's not really a restaurant. More like a food court mall booth. You definitely can't dine in. There were hella workers for a small ass place. We got the unagi roll and the salmon roll. The cashier asked if I wanted a bento box or all theses misc stuff they have on the side.

Anyhoo, my hubby didn't like the miso soup much. After I ate my roll, I looked in my bag and my spam musubi was NOWHERE to be found!!! Grrr!!! I was pissed. They forgot my musubi and I paid for it!! So I walked my ass all the way back and they were closed... Luckily the door wasn't closed. They had blocked the entrance with a bucket or something. I told the guy who seems to be the owner that they had forgot my musubi and he gave me two from the shelf... I was like it's okay??? Cuz I thought those were just displays like synthetic food. He apologized, I took the musubis assuming it was fresh since he's giving it to me and wouldn't give me old ones right??? Went back to the park.... Okay the musubis were old. Tried to eat at least half to get my moneys worth but was simply disappointed instead. So overall....I liked the rolls. The rolls were good. Kinda small. Kinda pricy so I would probably only come here once in a while. I don't recommend getting the musubi because it wasn't good. L&L tastes WAY better. I didn't get the musubi fresh so who knows. Maybe it tastes better fresh? They gave me an old one. The bento box and other random stuff behind the glass displays didn't look good anyways.

I would have liked it if they gave me a receipt so I can keep track of my order cuz what if someone makes a big order and they were missing stuff like how I was? The guy who seemed like he was owner was nice. He told me where I could find a public restroom down the street. Nice guy overall. But back to the food...I had a bittersweet experience because they forgot my food and I had to come all the way back and didn't get a fresh one. I would have been happier if they gave me a fresh one. Would I come back? Maybe once in a while. Still kinda small and pricey in my opinion.....so just 3 stars.

They make sandwiches. Back East we would call them grinders or submarine sandwiches. Anyway, at Subway you first choose your bread and the size (6\", 12\") and they put your sandy together using the assembly line method with the bread slicer person handing off to the filling stuffer. I only get the 12\" Vegetarian Delite on wheat with no onions, pickles, cheese, or hot peppers. It's pretty much a salad on bread and it tastes great with very low fat. I know what you are thinking - but wait, Colin, aren't there carbs in the bread? Yes, but don't worry about it. You need carbs to survive. The whole low carb thing is total bullshit - don't buy into it. Important note: eating at Subway is nothing like riding the subway in that it doesn't smell like puke or feature greasy dudes grabbing your ass. Also, stay away from that joynt Quiznos - so they toast the bread - big deal. I like my bread like my women - soft and squishy.
