How does a Mexican restaurant run out of cheese???!! It's game day, shouldn't have they known it would be busy????

They seriously sell a snickers bar for like $2.00! Who in their right mind does that?! Those giant cookies, kinda pricey; along with the pizza. The sandwiches are not bad though, it's usually about $7.00 or so for a sandwich and it is about 4,000 times better than any other sandwich place so, yeah.

Three tacos for $5. Their burritos are pretty delicious too. My only gripe is that they charge extra for stuff that should be standard with a SUPER burrito, like sour cream and guacamole. Aside from that, the burritos are really good and the meat doesn't have that burnt gristle that some other burrito places leave behind.
