We can't blame who the restaurant serves, money is money even if it comes from unsavory people. Anyway we were not greeted with bread immediately, only after we ordered did they bring us bread which is usually not seen, it sort of felt like, \"they ordered a lot of food so let's bring them bread.\" Instead of bringing complimentary bread to the table when you sit down. The oil they gave along with the bread was very tasty stuff and I'm not sure what was in it, maybe olives but it was really good, I could have eaten just bread for the whole meal if it came with the oil spread. Our waiter was nice enough and we cracked some jokes throughout the night and he was a very chill guy, glad we got him. I got a Turkish beer which is a pilsner and it had good flavor and I enjoyed it with my meal. We ordered Saganaki which is a cheese plate of some sort with figs that they bring in a small skillet next to your table and melt with alcohol right next to your table so you get a little fiery show out of it. It was pretty cool and we didn't expect that. The cheese had good flavor and paired well with the fig and we spread it on some bread and it was tasty stuff but could have used more fig. For entrees I got the Manti and the girl got the Iskender. The manti is a meat filled pasta covered in Mediterranean spices and yogurt sauce as the pasta sauce. It was very unique which is the first thing that came to mind when I tried it but I ended up enjoying the flavors and textures of the dish. It is definitely something I have never had before but I liked it. However I tried my girls Iskender and it was my favorite dish. Meat in a red sauce with pita, tomato, side of yogurt sauce and peppers and it was very tasty from start to finish. Both dishes were great entrees and we enjoyed both. For dessert I got a Turkish coffee and we split a deconstructed baklava with pistachios and marscapone cheese. It was to die for, a little honey, some crunch and the creaminess from the cheese made for a perfect dessert to end our night. Overall the food was very different from the norm that I am used to but it tasted fantastic and the service was great as well.
