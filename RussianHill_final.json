Still, mop around the toilet fellas! I didn't see it, so I can't confirm her findings. However, sullied bathroom aside, this place is fantastic. Inventive without being crazy. Bites with all parts of a plate, or pieces of it, were equally delicious. I had the sea bass, my fellow diner had the duck for our entrees, both were fantastic. Our snacks & starters were the potato egg balls, which in reviewing fellow yelpers' pictures, our may have been a bit overcooked as our yolks were solid. Still yummy, but would have preferred a looser yolk. We also had the mushroom ragout, which was super flavorful and delicious and the squid ink pasta which was quite lovely -- especially the foam which seemed to be a very delicate sweet onion. \u00a0Dessert was a tough choice, so we didn't choose and got both the s'mores and the pb&j donuts.

More sausage to noodles would be great. I find their pairings to be very sharp in contrast. Take the duck salad. Where you may want to see a nice lemon balance with a duck salad, they put maytag blue on it. It's like throwing a hand grenade into the whole dish muting the subtle warm rich tones of confit duck.

Let me clarify, I did not set foot outside of the door I only looked outside to make sure my girlfriend was OK. At this point, the bartender very rudely asked me to give him my drink. I believe he was trying to make up for his prior mistake of letting us take the drinks outside and to look good in front of the owner. Once again, I did not put up a fight and gave him my drink and the bartender never mentioned that I was cut off or could not have another drink.

I looked over and my gf was digging through her chicken gyros plate looking for an edible piece with a distressed look on her face. I popped open my lamb gyros plate and was shocked to find the majority of the piece had huge veins/fatty tissue. There was barely any edible meat. It was all fat. The rice on each plate was literal mush. And to top it off this place somehow found a way to screw up hummus. What we got was bland and almost play dough like in texture. Pita bread was ok though. We gave everything one bite and boxed it back up. Some might say we caught them on an \"off night\"... Fuck that. The food their employees knowingly gave us looked terrible and tasted even worse!

I've been to this place enough to feel like I have a solid opinion developed. The first time I went here I was confused and now when I go I am just accepting of the slexyness to be had here. Let me tell you about the disorienting aspects first and then maybe we'll get to the good stuff. \u00a0I wouldn't say there are things that are sour about this bar (and especially because I like sour things I don't want to use that word..speaking of which, NocNoc in the Haight always seems to have a sour beer available I'm pretty much guaranteed to like). I wouldn't say things are pushing it, even. Just a little disorienting for the sake of being confusing and, well, disorienting. Not in a \"WOA did you see that over there?\" Or \"Isn't it weird humans have ears?\" kinda disorienting way, just in a more.....\"I don't get it\" sort of way. But then, I'm not super into playing pool and watching televisions at bars, so maybe it's me with the issue. Anyway, for your reference, there's lots of standing room, and in my experience, sitting down to have a drink is somewhat disastrous because there's not a lot of comfortable places to sit and it's hard to hear each other at that. There's a decent smoking section outside that makes this place look poppin'. So you walk in past that patio, a big huge atm, and into the actual bar area and theres a kick ass selection of beer. I highly recommend the Heretic Red Ale. The Red beers here are always good. It's dim lit, it can take a while to get a drink. The bartenders have never done me wrong though, they are working quick, sometimes it's just crowded. TVs all around with sports on. This place is pretty good for big groups, there is a little something for everyone looking to be somewhat rowdy. There's barstools around the bar and then in the back there's some large round tables besides the pool tables and a TV, last time I was here on Friday they were playing 300. Between the bar and this back area is a spot to order Indian food. There's also this funny room with lounge seating opposite the spot to order food, although it is more brightly lit than anywhere else. I think people sleep behind the bench seats sometimes - there's a ratchet mess behind them full of junk. I've only had the food once and I still haven't sat specifically in the designated dining area that is also a part of Kennedy's. I split an order of fried shrimp and smosas (erm...not my choice..) which were kinda dry but got the job done as far as bulky fried drunky food goes. The orders were pretty big, we ended up sharing with our table. Nothing about this place is sexy, but there's plenty of sloppy (more slexy: slutty/sexy than sexy). It's an interesting neighborhood, and, as other people mentioned, the ingenuity of indian food + irish pub is kind of striking. I've only met really standard characters here, standard in that bro-y sort of way, but what can one expect in North Beach? Oh, and my friend was standing in the smoking patio smoking a j and someone who works there (owner? maybe?) was standing there and sort of gestured for him to gtfo.

Then again this is fisherman's wharf where all the tourists cling to. Service was good. We were checked on several times. Our Calamari was very delicious indeed crisp batter which was well seasoned, although it had a ton of thyme in the batter which I don't mind. But after it being in the clam chowder as well which it shouldn't be in a classic clam chowder soup it got to be over whelming in taste. I felt the clam chowder was over kill in taste of thyme. You could barely taste the creamy silky broth of the chowder or even the melt in your mouth clams. I always love my chowder spiked with tabasco & this didn't even help it. I suggest they get rid of the thyme in the clam chowder & add it to their Cioppino instead. I understand that this is an Italian restaurant but don't mess with an old time classic.
